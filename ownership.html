<h1>Cat Ownership in Aotearoa</h1>
<p>Did you know 64% of Kiwi households own at least one pet, just a smidge behind the USA (65%)?
   Collectively, New Zealanders own 4.6 million pets - that's more pets than people!<br><br>
   Cats are the most popular pets – 44% of New Zealand homes have one, for a total of 1.1 million pet cats.<br><br>
   Why do we love our pets so much? Maybe it’s because we have a relaxed pace of life and a good work-life balance, giving us time to enjoy our furry friends. Perhaps it’s having plenty of room to keep animals in most parts of the country. Maybe it’s because they fit into our active outdoor lifestyles. Whatever the reason, our love of pets seems to be getting stronger.</p>
