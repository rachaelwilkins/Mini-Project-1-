Hello, this is Mini Project 1 for my IOD Software Engineering Certificate.

Given the uptake in pet ownership since the pandemic, I have created a website which contains a library on over 60 breeds of cats (data procured from API data). Aside that, there are multiple webpages containing information such as contact information, information on how to adot, and also a shop for buying pet accessories and food.
